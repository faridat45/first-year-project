# Ocean Pollution Simulation (Processing Project)

This is an interactive simulation built with **Processing (Java)** to highlight the issue of ocean pollution.  

In the simulation, youâ€™ll see fish swimming in the ocean alongside floating debris (plastic bottles, wrappers, plastic bags, etc.).  

Hover your mouse over a piece of debris to display a graph showing how the amount of that pollutant has increased over time.  
*(Note: the data is fictional, created for demonstration purposes only.)*
